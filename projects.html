            <b>pdf_merge</b> is a utitity for merging the front and back of scanned PDFs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Both the simplest and useful project I have on GitHub. I usually don't upload (or write about)
            such simple tools I build, but I use this tool so often I needed to make sure I had the 
            installation instructions ready if I ever switch computers.
        </p>
        <p>
            The inspiration for <b>pdf_merge</b> came from my role as a peer tutor. I typically review
            the topics that students request before our sessions by working through a couple practice
            problems. Instead of tossing that work in the trash, I scan and share them
            with students. Unfortunately, my scanner doesn't scan front and back with the document feeder.
            With <b>pdf_merge</b>, I can quickly merge the PDFs by typing "pdf_merge" in the terminal and 
            selecting the two files.

        <p>
            <b>vchat</b> is a web application for sending messages and sharing files over your local network. It was developed using the 
            <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a> framework. Users can register and chat or share files with other 
            users on the network.
        </p>
        <p>
            Writing a chat web app is a classic beginner programming project, but it came out of a real desire for me to easily
            communicate between devices on my home network. I often found myself in a situation where I had a StackOverflow page
            pulled up on my phone and I really wanted it on my computer. It's much easier to send the link over chat rather than 
            searching for it again.<br/><br/>
            In the past, I had played with some socket programming in Python and Java, but I found it was much more of hassle to
            get that running, and besides I couldn't get that working on my phone.<br/><br/>
            <b>vchat</b> also marks the future of naming my projects just a regular word, but prepending `v` to them - the first
            letter of my name. Naming things is hard! And I must admit I'm not too great at coming up with interesting names for them,
            so <b>v</b> + [INSERT WORD HERE] will do for now.

            I (like many people) have been enjoying playing online chess recently; however, playing online
            chess isn't the most productive thing you can do, so instead I spent some time programming some chess logic.
            <br/><br/>
            I decided to bring the chess logic in to a standalone web app, because I was taking a course in Advanced Python where I 
            was learning about building REST APIs and at the same time I was taking a course in JavaScript. Building a chess web
            app was a perfect (and fun!) way to study for both courses.

    <h1 class="card-title">Terminal Chess</h1>
    <p>
        The Terminal Chess program is for playing chess in the terminal on a UNIX-like system.
        <br/><br/>
        Previously, I had written a chess program in PyGame, and it was one of the first "bigger" project I ever took on.
        The PyGame program I wrote, however, was what they call spaghetti code. I was even to ashamed to upload it to GitHub,
        and even I barely could remember how it worked.
        <br/><br/>
        I decided to rewrite a chess program with my knowledge of what parts needed to fit together, and separating out the 
        chess game logic from the interface after learning MVC architectures.<br/>
        When I finished writing and testing the piece and board components, I wasn't quite sure how I wanted to implement the UI,
        but then I discovered the Python <code>curses</code> library. I found it was pretty quick to make a terminal version and I could 
        learn a little about how to implement the controller aspect.
    </p>

    <h3 class="card-title">Alpha-Beta Search & C++</h3>
    <p>
        After I had written the terminal chess application and a standalone web app, I read about minimax search. I was so excited
        to try those algorithms out on my program. Well, I found out the hardway that the algorithm is the least difficult part of 
        the process. My alpha-beta search algorithm took a whole minute just to search 3 ply in Python.
        <br/><br/>
        I did some research online and it seemed the opinion of the experts was that you shouldn't try to that kind of search in Python.
        I was disappointed, but then I discovered the <code>ctypes</code> library, where you can compile C and C++ code to a shared library,
        then call the functions from Python.
        <br/><br/>
        I spent an entire weekend rewriting the chess logic with alpha-beta search in C++, so excited to play the algorithm in chess.
        But when I went to play it, it was actually slower than the Python version. Drats!<br/>
        It was a great learning experience though.
        <br/><br/>
        I found the real problem is the implementation of the game is sub-optimal, and my C++ implementation, even more so.
        So unfortunately the shared library remains a branch on GitHub, but if you want to check it out, you can find it
        <a href="https://github.com/vincentarcuri/terminal-chess/tree/CPP-Minimax" target="_blank">here</a>. Or if you want to just check out the C++ implementation,
        you can find that <a href="https://github.com/vincentarcuri/cpp-chess-files", target="_blank">here</a>. My future with the project will have to involve
        bitboards, so once I have time I will dive in.

    This is the stuff I'm working on right now, but is not on GitHub or other platforms yet.
    <h3 class="card-title">Economic Data Dashboard with Dash</h3>
    <p>
        Many of my projects on GitHub fall under the category of web development, because it's nice
        to share something visual. They were fun to make, but web development isn't necessarily
        the direction I'm heading in my career. I wanted to create useful tools, but I've realized
        their true utility lies in the skills I learn while creating them. This will be a transition to
        using my projects to sharpen my data skills.
    </p>
    <p>
        During my internship as a data analyst, I realized how important it is to be able to gather raw data,
        clean it, load it in a database, transform it, and visualize it. For this project, I'm using publicly
        available data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis and the Bureau of Labor Statistics to visualize
        key economic indicators in dashboard. For this project, I'll be playing with some cool features of 
        Postgres and using Dash for the first time.
