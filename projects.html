    <div class="card-content">
        <p>
            <b>vchat</b> is a web application for sending messages and sharing files over your local network. It was developed using the 
            <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a> framework. Users can register and chat or share files with other 
            users on the network.
        </p>
        <p>
            Writing a chat web app is a classic beginner programming project, but it came out of a real desire for me to easily
            communicate between devices on my home network. I often found myself in a situation where I had a StackOverflow page
            pulled up on my phone and I really wanted it on my computer. It's much easier to send the link over chat rather than 
            searching for it again.<br/><br/>
            In the past, I had played with some socket programming in Python and Java, but I found it was much more of hassle to
            get that running, and besides I couldn't get that working on my phone.<br/><br/>
            <b>vchat</b> also marks the future of naming my projects just a regular word, but prepending `v` to them - the first
            letter of my name. Naming things is hard! And I must admit I'm not too great at coming up with interesting names for them,
            so <b>v</b> + [INSERT WORD HERE] will do for now.

            I (like many people) have been enjoying playing online chess recently; however, playing online
            chess isn't the most productive thing you can do, so instead I spent some time programming some chess logic.
            <br/><br/>
            I decided to bring the chess logic in to a standalone web app, because I was taking a course in Advanced Python where I 
            was learning about building REST APIs and at the same time I was taking a course in JavaScript. Building a chess web
            app was a perfect (and fun!) way to study for both courses.

    <h1 class="card-title">Terminal Chess</h1>
    <p>
        The Terminal Chess program is for playing chess in the terminal on a UNIX-like system.
        <br/><br/>
        Previously, I had written a chess program in PyGame, and it was one of the first "bigger" project I ever took on.
        The PyGame program I wrote, however, was what they call spaghetti code. I was even to ashamed to upload it to GitHub,
        and even I barely could remember how it worked.
        <br/><br/>
        I decided to rewrite a chess program with my knowledge of what parts needed to fit together, and separating out the 
        chess game logic from the interface after learning MVC architectures.<br/>
        When I finished writing and testing the piece and board components, I wasn't quite sure how I wanted to implement the UI,
        but then I discovered the Python <code>curses</code> library. I found it was pretty quick to make a terminal version and I could 
        learn a little about how to implement the controller aspect.

    <h3 class="card-title">Alpha-Beta Search & C++</h3>
    <p>
        After I had written the terminal chess application and a standalone web app, I read about minimax search. I was so excited
        to try those algorithms out on my program. Well, I found out the hardway that the algorithm is the least difficult part of 
        the process. My alpha-beta search algorithm took a whole minute just to search 3 ply in Python.
        <br/><br/>
        I did some research online and it seemed the opinion of the experts was that you shouldn't try to that kind of search in Python.
        I was disappointed, but then I discovered the <code>ctypes</code> library, where you can compile C and C++ code to a shared library,
        then call the functions from Python.
        <br/><br/>
        I spent an entire weekend rewriting the chess logic with alpha-beta search in C++, so excited to play the algorithm in chess.
        But when I went to play it, it was actually slower than the Python version. Drats!<br/>
        It was a great learning experience though.
        <br/><br/>
        I found the real problem is the implementation of the game is sub-optimal, and my C++ implementation, even more so.
        So unfortunately the shared library remains a branch on GitHub, but if you want to check it out, you can find it
        <a href="https://github.com/vincentarcuri/terminal-chess/tree/CPP-Minimax" target="_blank">here</a>. Or if you want to just check out the C++ implementation,
        you can find that <a href="https://github.com/vincentarcuri/cpp-chess-files", target="_blank">here</a>. My future with the project will have to involve
        bitboards, so once I have time I will dive in.

    This is the stuff I'm working on right now, but is not on GitHub or other platforms yet.
    <h3 class="card-title">vmathPy & vmathCpp</h3>
    <p>
        Last semester I took a Data Structures & Algorithms class, and I thought binary trees were coolest
        thing in the world. Also, I love writing functions that correspond with what I'm learning in math class.
        Well, what a great time to write a Recursive Descent Parser for math equations! I've always been annoyed
        that I had to keep defining a new function and pass it as an argument, but now I can just pass a string.
        The Python version is basically complete, but I need to add my math functions to it. And the C++ parser is in
        the works. Why do both languages? I don't know; it's fun!
    </p>
    <h3 class="card-title">Azure DataBricks & PySpark</h3>
    <p>
        I'm currently taking an online course in DataBricks and PySpark. After finishing learning, I plan
        on building some of my own projects and doing some data analysis. Most likely in the form of articles.
