        <p>
            <b>vchat</b> is a web application for sending messages and sharing files over your local network. It was developed using the 
            <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/">Flask</a> framework. Users can register and chat or share files with other 
            users on the network.
        </p>
        <p>
            Writing a chat web app is a classic beginner programming project, but it came out of a real desire for me to easily
            communicate between devices on my home network. I often found myself in a situation where I had a StackOverflow page
            pulled up on my phone and I really wanted it on my computer. It's much easier to send the link over chat rather than 
            searching for it again.<br/><br/>
            In the past, I had played with some socket programming in Python and Java, but I found it was much more of hassle to
            get that running, and besides I couldn't get that working on my phone.<br/><br/>
            <b>vchat</b> also marks the future of naming my projects just a regular word, but prepending `v` to them - the first
            letter of my name. Naming things is hard! And I must admit I'm not too great at coming up with interesting names for them,
            so <b>v</b> + [INSERT WORD HERE] will do for now.

            I've (like many people) have been enjoying playing online chess recently; however, playing online
            chess isn't the most productive thing you can do, so instead I spent some time programming some chess logic.
            <br/><br/>
            I decided to bring the chess logic in to a standalone web app, because I was taking a course in Advanced Python where I 
            was learning about building REST APIs and at the same time I was taking a course in JavaScript. Building a chess web
            app was a perfect (and fun!) way to study for both courses.
