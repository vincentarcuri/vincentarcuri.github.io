        <h4>Sepember 8, 2022</h4>
        <hr>
        <h2>Here's why you don't have to...</h2>
        <p>
            From the COVID-19 layoffs to the <a href="https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/nobody-wants-to-work-anymore"
                target="_blank" rel="noopener">‘nobody wants to work anymore’ signs</a>, the restaurant worker shortage
            is <em>still </em>in the <a
                href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/food/2022/08/15/restaurant-perks-worker-shortage/" target="_blank"
                rel="noopener">news</a>, so I decided to look at the data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics to see
            what was going on.
        </p>
        <p>
            I worked in the restaurant industry for several years (including during the pandemic), and when we weren’t
            sending out hot plates of food or packing up stacks of takeout orders, you might’ve caught us talking about
            the restaurant worker shortage. The typical remarks included:
        </p>
        <p>“It’s not a worker shortage, it’s a <em>wage </em>shortage.”</p>
        <p>“People were starting to leave the industry anyway.”</p>
        <p>“They found other jobs, and aren’t coming back”.</p>
        <p>The true reason might be up for debate; the answer most likely being ‘D’ — all of the above. The question I
            want to answer is <em>will they be coming back?</em></p>
        <h2>Where we were, where we are, and what could have been.</h2>
        <p>
            Depending on the news source you’re reading, it varies how many workers are missing from the industry, so I
            want to be up front with the data I’m using. The data comes from the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)
            ‘National Employment, Hours, and Earnings’ survey with North American Industry Classification (NAICS) code
            7225 — ‘Restaurants and Other Eating Places’. The restaurant workers that we’ll be looking at are
            ‘production and nonsupervisory employees’.
        </p>
        <p>From the <a href="https://www.bls.gov/web/empsit/cestn.htm" target="_blank" rel="noopener">BLS website</a>:
        </p>
        <blockquote>
            <p>PRODUCTION AND RELATED EMPLOYEES</p>
            <p>
                This category includes working supervisors and all nonsupervisory employees (including group leaders and
                trainees) engaged in fabricating, processing, assembling, inspecting, receiving, storing, handling,
                packing, warehousing, shipping, trucking, hauling, maintenance, repair, janitorial, guard services,
                product development, auxiliary production for plant's own use (for example, power plant), recordkeeping,
                and other services closely associated with the described production operations.
            </p>
            <p>NONSUPERVISORY EMPLOYEES</p>
            <p>These are employees (not above the working-supervisor level) such as office and clerical employees,
                repairers, salespersons, operators, drivers, physicians, lawyers, accountants, nurses, social employees,
                research aides, teachers, drafters, photographers, beauticians, musicians, restaurant employees,
                custodial employees, attendants, line installers and repairers, laborers, janitors, guards, and other
                employees at similar occupational levels whose services are closely associated with those of the
                employees listed.</p>

        <p>
            Below is a chart showing the number of restaurant employees since 2013. I used pre-pandemic data to project
            the number of workers there would be today.

            The data shows that the number of restaurant employees is around 930 thousand <em>less </em>than it should
            be
            due to the pandemic. However, even though the economy may have ‘bounced-back’ from the pandemic recession,
            it certainly stunted its growth. Restaurant employee numbers are highly correlated with the total number of
            private sector employees (all employees not working in farms or the government.) Private sector employee
            numbers are almost 5 million short of their projected value, although they have surpassed their pre-pandemic
            level; restaurant employees have not.

        <h2>The shortage isn’t as bad as it seems.</h2>
        <p>
            Yes, there are less restaurant employees than there used to be, but the extent of the loss is overblown by
            the news cycle. The data shows that the number of restaurant employees is continually hovering around 5.97%
            less than expected, given the number of private sector employees; indicating the restaurant shortage might
            be here to stay.

            The shortage is overblown because the percentage of workers employed in restaurants is down 5.86% from
            pre-pandemic levels, but is down less than one percent from 2013 levels — the industry has seen this before.
            That percentage gradually rose overtime, but the industry very quickly experienced a lot of changes.
        </p>
        <h2>Maybe the industry needs less workers…</h2>
        <p>
            The pandemic accelerated industries toward more efficient practices and technologies; many that were widely
            available but underutilized — like remote work and video conferencing. The restaurant industry was no
            different. In order to operate under lockdowns and social distancing measures restaurants adopted online
            ordering, QR code menus, and contracts with food delivery companies. Many restaurants invested heavily in
            those systems and continue to use them. Another interesting graph shows the average number of workers per
            restaurant.

                Restaurants today, on average, are operating with about 1.6 less workers than they were before the
                pandemic. Automation has been coming for restaurant jobs in the form of online ordering apps and
                contactless kiosks now in use by many of the larger chains, while smaller restaurants have chosen to
                shorten their hours to peak times. Also adding more than 84% of consumers say they are eating out less
                often according to this <a
                    href="https://morningconsult.com/2022/06/21/inflation-has-consumers-cutting-back-on-dining-and-meat/"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener">survey</a>, it’s likely that restaurants need less people to operate
                today.

                With all these factors that limit the number of employees a restaurant needs, we can ask a different
                question: <em>is the restaurant worker shortage something new?</em> A quick search for pre-pandemic
                restaurant shortage articles does not leave one wanting — like this <a
                    href="https://www.nytimes.com/2018/04/05/dining/labor-shortage-restaurants-employment.html"
                    target="_blank" rel="noopener">one from the New York Times</a> (from 2018 when restaurant employment
                was fairly high). For an industry with a notoriously high turnover rate, lower than average wages, and
                few benefits, staffing has always been an issue, and that’s probably not going to change anytime soon.
                If restaurants are able to operate more efficiently with less employees, they could funnel some of those
                savings into staff retention measures that could cut down the turnover rate. However, it will still be a
                while before restaurants see returns on their operational investments, especially with diners dwindling
                from inflation. So, for the most part, it looks like the restaurant worker shortage is here to stay, but
                it’s not that bad and definitely isn’t new.
